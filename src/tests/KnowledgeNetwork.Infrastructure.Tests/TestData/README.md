# Infrastructure Test Data

Test data, fixtures, and samples for KnowledgeNetwork.Infrastructure testing.

## Purpose
Centralized location for infrastructure component test data:
- Database seed data and migration scripts
- Configuration files for various test scenarios
- Sample data for external API mocking
- Performance test datasets
- Error scenario data for resilience testing

## Organization Structure
- `DatabaseSeeds/` - SQL scripts and seed data for database testing
- `ConfigurationFiles/` - JSON/XML configuration files for testing
- `ApiMockData/` - Sample responses from external APIs
- `PerformanceData/` - Large datasets for load and performance testing
- `ErrorScenarios/` - Data for testing error handling and edge cases

## Data Categories
- **Database Data**: Seed scripts, migration data, test schemas
- **Configuration Data**: Various config formats and environment settings
- **External API Data**: Mock responses and test payloads
- **Performance Data**: Large datasets for scalability testing
- **Error Data**: Malformed data, connection failures, timeout scenarios

## Usage Guidelines
- Keep test data representative of production scenarios
- Use realistic data volumes for performance testing
- Include both valid and invalid data for comprehensive testing
- Document data relationships and dependencies
- Keep sensitive data anonymized or use synthetic data

## Current Status
Infrastructure layer currently has minimal implementation - test data will be added as components are developed.
