# Infrastructure Integration Tests

Integration tests for KnowledgeNetwork.Infrastructure components with real external dependencies.

## Purpose
Test infrastructure components with actual external systems:
- Database integration (PostgreSQL + Apache AGE)
- File system operations
- External API integrations
- Configuration providers with real settings
- Cache implementations with actual cache stores

## Future Test Areas
As Infrastructure layer expands, integration test areas will include:
- Database connectivity and schema validation
- Graph database operations and AGE extension functionality
- Repository implementations with real database
- External service integrations (APIs, message queues)
- File system abstractions with actual file operations
- Configuration management with various sources
- Logging and monitoring integrations

## Testing Approach
- Use real external dependencies in controlled test environment
- Test complete workflows from infrastructure through to external systems
- Validate error handling with actual failure scenarios
- Test performance characteristics with real data volumes
- Use containerized dependencies (Docker) for consistent test environment
- Test configuration variations and environment-specific behaviors

## Current Status
Infrastructure layer currently has minimal implementation - integration tests will be added as components are developed.
