# Test Data

Test data, fixtures, and sample data specific to KnowledgeNetwork.Core tests.

## Purpose
Centralized location for:
- Sample knowledge graphs for testing
- Mock data for domain models
- Test fixtures for complex scenarios
- Expected results for validation tests
- JSON files with test data

## Organization
- Keep test data close to the tests that use it
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include both simple and complex scenarios
- Provide both valid and invalid data for testing edge cases

## Examples
- `SampleKnowledgeGraphs/` - Pre-built graph structures
- `MockNodeData/` - Sample node and edge data
- `ExpectedResults/` - Expected outputs for validation
- `EdgeCases/` - Data for testing boundary conditions
