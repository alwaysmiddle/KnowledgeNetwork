# Class Analyzer Tests

Unit tests for `CSharpClassRelationshipAnalyzer` and class relationship analysis functionality.

## Purpose
Test the analysis of C# class relationships, inheritance, and structural patterns.

## Production Code Under Test
- `CSharpClassRelationshipAnalyzer.cs` - Analyzes class relationships and inheritance hierarchies

## Test Focus Areas
- Class inheritance relationships (base classes)
- Interface implementation detection
- Composition and aggregation relationships
- Nested class relationships
- Class dependencies and coupling
- Generic class relationships
- Abstract class and interface analysis

## Sample Test Scenarios
- Simple class inheritance chains
- Multiple interface implementations
- Complex inheritance hierarchies
- Nested and inner classes
- Generic class relationships
- Cross-assembly dependencies
- Circular dependency detection

## Test File Naming
`CSharpClassRelationshipAnalyzerTests.cs`
