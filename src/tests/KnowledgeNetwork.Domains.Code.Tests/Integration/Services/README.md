# Service Integration Tests

Integration tests for service orchestration with real C# projects and complete analysis workflows.

## Purpose
Test the complete service layer with real codebases and end-to-end analysis scenarios.

## Integration Focus
- Complete `CSharpAnalysisService` workflows with real projects
- Integration with actual file system and project structures
- End-to-end analysis from source code to knowledge graph
- Performance testing with large codebases
- Error handling with real-world malformed code

## Real Project Scenarios
- Analyze complete open-source C# projects
- Performance testing with large solutions
- Multi-project analysis workflows
- Integration with various C# language features
- Error recovery with incomplete or invalid projects

## Testing Approach
- Use real C# projects and solutions
- Test complete analysis pipelines
- Validate integration between all service components
- Performance benchmarking with realistic projects
- End-to-end validation of analysis accuracy

## Test File Naming
