# Method Analyzer Integration Tests

Integration tests for `CSharpMethodRelationshipAnalyzer` with real C# codebases and method call chains.

## Purpose
Test method analysis with complete codebases and real method interaction patterns.

## Integration Focus
- Real method call graph construction across projects
- Integration with actual polymorphic calls
- Cross-assembly method analysis
- Performance testing with large call graphs
- Validation against known method interaction patterns

## Real Code Scenarios
- Complex method call chains across multiple classes
- Polymorphic method invocation analysis
- Framework method interactions (ASP.NET, EF, etc.)
- Large-scale method dependency analysis
- Performance-critical call path analysis

## Test File Naming
`CSharpMethodRelationshipAnalyzerIntegrationTests.cs`
