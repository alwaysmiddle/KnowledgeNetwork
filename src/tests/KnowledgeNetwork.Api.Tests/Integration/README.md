# API Integration Tests

Integration tests for KnowledgeNetwork.Api with real HTTP requests and full application pipeline.

## Purpose
Test the complete API layer with real HTTP requests and end-to-end scenarios:
- Full HTTP request/response cycles
- Integration with authentication providers
- Database integration through complete API workflows
- Performance testing under realistic load
- API contract validation with real clients

## Future Test Areas
As API layer expands, integration test areas will include:
- Complete CRUD operations through API endpoints
- Authentication flows with real JWT tokens
- Authorization scenarios with actual user roles
- File upload and download workflows
- WebSocket connections and real-time features
- API rate limiting under actual load
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) validation
- API versioning with multiple client scenarios
- Performance benchmarking with realistic payloads

## Testing Approach
- Use TestServer with real HTTP client for full integration
- Test complete authentication and authorization flows
- Validate API responses against OpenAPI specifications
- Test with realistic data volumes and concurrent requests
- Use containerized dependencies for consistent test environment
- Test error scenarios with actual HTTP error responses
- Validate API documentation accuracy with real requests

## Current Status
API layer currently has minimal implementation - integration tests will be added as endpoints and middleware are developed.
