# Converter Integration Tests

Integration tests for data conversion components with real analysis data and complete workflows.

## Purpose
Test converters with real analysis results and end-to-end data transformation pipelines.

## Integration Focus
- Complete analysis-to-graph conversion workflows
- Real Roslyn data to KnowledgeNode transformation
- Performance testing with large analysis datasets
- Validation of complete conversion pipelines
- Integration with downstream graph processing

## Real Data Scenarios
- Large Control Flow Graph conversions
- Complex class hierarchy transformations
- Multi-file analysis result conversions
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- End-to-end analysis â†’ visualization pipelines

## Testing Approach
- Use real analysis results from integration test scenarios
- Test complete conversion workflows
- Validate data integrity through full pipeline
- Performance benchmarking with realistic datasets
