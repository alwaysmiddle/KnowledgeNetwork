# File Analyzer Integration Tests

Integration tests for `CSharpFileDependencyAnalyzer` with real C# projects and dependencies.

## Purpose
Test file analysis with complete project structures and real dependency chains.

## Integration Focus
- Real project dependency analysis
- Integration with actual NuGet packages
- Cross-project reference analysis
- Performance testing with large solutions
- Validation against known project structures

## Real Code Scenarios
- Multi-project solutions with complex dependencies
- NuGet package dependency analysis
- Circular dependency detection in real projects
- Large-scale namespace organization
- Framework and library integration patterns
