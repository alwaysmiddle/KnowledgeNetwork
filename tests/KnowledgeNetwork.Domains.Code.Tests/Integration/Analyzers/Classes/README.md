# Class Analyzer Integration Tests

Integration tests for `CSharpClassRelationshipAnalyzer` with real C# projects and inheritance hierarchies.

## Purpose
Test class analysis with complete projects and real inheritance structures.

## Integration Focus
- Real class relationship analysis across multiple files
- Integration with actual project references
- Cross-assembly class analysis
- Performance testing with large class hierarchies
- Validation against known complex inheritance patterns

## Real Code Scenarios
- Multi-project inheritance hierarchies
- Interface implementations across assemblies
- Generic class relationships in real projects
- Complex composition patterns
- Framework integration patterns (MVC, DI, etc.)

## Test File Naming
`CSharpClassRelationshipAnalyzerIntegrationTests.cs`
