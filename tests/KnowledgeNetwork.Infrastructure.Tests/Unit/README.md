# Infrastructure Unit Tests

Unit tests for KnowledgeNetwork.Infrastructure components in isolation.

## Purpose
Test infrastructure components with mocked external dependencies:
- Data access layer components
- Caching implementations
- External service integrations
- Configuration providers
- Repository patterns

## Future Test Areas
As Infrastructure layer expands, test areas will include:
- Database context and repositories
- Graph database access (PostgreSQL + Apache AGE)
- Caching service implementations
- External API integrations
- File system abstractions
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring components

## Testing Approach
- Mock all external dependencies (databases, APIs, file system)
- Focus on business logic within infrastructure components
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Validate configuration handling
- Test retry and circuit breaker patterns
- Use in-memory implementations where appropriate

## Current Status
Infrastructure layer currently has minimal implementation - tests will be added as components are developed.
