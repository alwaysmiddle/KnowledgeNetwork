# API Unit Tests

Unit tests for KnowledgeNetwork.Api components in isolation.

## Purpose
Test API layer components with mocked dependencies:
- Controllers with mocked services
- Request/response models and validation
- Authentication and authorization logic
- API middleware components
- Custom attributes and filters

## Future Test Areas
As API layer expands, test areas will include:
- Controller action methods with various inputs
- Request validation and model binding
- Response formatting and serialization
- Authentication middleware and JWT handling
- Authorization policies and role-based access
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and throttling logic
- Error handling and exception filters
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation

## Testing Approach
- Mock all service dependencies (application services, repositories)
- Focus on HTTP-specific logic and behaviors
- Test request/response transformation
- Validate authentication and authorization flows
- Test error handling and status code responses
- Use in-memory test server for integration-like scenarios
- Test API contract compliance and documentation accuracy

## Current Status
API layer currently has minimal implementation - tests will be added as controllers and middleware are developed.
